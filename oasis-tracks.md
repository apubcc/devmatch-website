About
Oasis is home to Sapphire, the world‚Äôs first confidential EVM network powered by a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), and ROFL, a framework that enables confidential off-chain compute. Oasis is a Layer 0/1 blockchain designed to support scalable, privacy-preserving applications. Its unique layered architecture offers an optimal environment for building and running applications in DeFi, AI, real-world assets (RWAs), gaming, NFTs, DAO governance, and more.

Judging Criteria

Potential Impact: How big an impact could the project have?
Confidentiality: Does the project utilize the unique capabilities of ROFL and Sapphire to solve an important problem?
UX: Does the design make the user experience seamless?
Innovation: How well does the project combine or extend ROFL with technologies that weren‚Äôt used before?
Implementation Quality: Submitted code is working and uses Oasis tooling correctly.
Bonus ROFL-Sapphire integration points: Your dApp correctly authenticates ROFL transactions via the roflEnsureAuthorizedOrigin subcall and uses Sapphire‚Äôs unique precompiles and confidentiality to assure that confidential data never leaks out of the TEE.

Qualification Requirements

Demo video up to three minutes long
A text description explaining the features and functionality of your project
An open-source Github repository with a complete README
A way to test the project, including a link to the app or testing instructions
Complete the submission form by the final deadline
Optional: Present your hack at the booth that you don‚Äôt get overlooked

Workshop dates 21st July - 1st Aug (weekends included) from 6pm to 9pm
Workshop 1 (Sapphire) - 23rd July 7pm GMT+8 (Bernhard)
Workshop 2 (Rofl) - 30th July 7pm GMT+8 (Bernhard)

What to build:

Explore the Oasis Network‚Äôs familiar development environment with industry-leading confidentiality. Discover a new world of opportunities for developers across all EVM networks.

New teams who are building in crypto are invited to integrate Oasis technology into their early-stage application to improve user experience and on-chain data confidentiality.

Builders who have already launched applications in crypto are also invited to explore Oasis confidential computing for the benefits it could add to your existing userbase.

What is Sapphire:

Oasis Sapphire ‚Äî the first and only confidential EVM in production ‚Äî provides developers with the ability to build EVM-based dApps with customizable levels of privacy.

Sapphire‚Äôs confidential computing gives builders the tools to integrate privacy at any point of the spectrum: 100% private, 100% public, or anywhere in between.

What is ROFL:

ROFL (Runtime Off-Chain Logic) is a framework that adds support for off-chain components to runtimes like Oasis Sapphire. It enables non-deterministic behavior and access to remote network resources.

ROFL also allows for off-chain components to seamlessly communicate with the onchain realm to bring about full composability across different blockchain platforms and off-chain computation stacks.

ROFL enables decentralized agents powered by AI to have private state and interact with the world including other agents via transactions, queries and oracles, making it much easier to run complex workloads in a decentralized fashion.

Ideas to Get Started

AI Agents
With Sapphire, you can store agent private keys on-chain and then build logic within a smart contract, and with ROFL, you can verify offchain agent workloads, in order to pursue use cases in trading, admin, security, wallets, collaborative art, etc. Oasis provides you all the tools to build truly autonomous and trustless agents. Generate private keys from within a TEE, store secrets on the Confidential EVM and let your agent loose on socials or DeFi dApps.

Trustless Oracles
Because the ROFL framework enables verifiable and confidential off-chain computation with internet access to web2 and web3 APIs, governed by the policies stored on-chain, there‚Äôs no need to trust the Oracle operator for fetching the price quotes and much more. You can even submit transactions to other chains.

DeFi
Privacy-preserving applications around dark pools, cross-chain liquidity, dutch auctions for tokens, ICO price discovery via auctions, DEX & cross-chain swaps, and more!

Gaming
Break the link between in-game profiles and on-chain accounts, create trustless, hidden fog of war mechanics, explore the agent-gaming design space, all to build captivating games!

Other
Account abstraction and gasless wallets. Trustless cryptography with confidential contracts. Applications for encrypted metadata, secrets, and key management.
